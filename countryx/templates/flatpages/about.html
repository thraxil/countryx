            <h1>About RamlaCMMsim</h1>
            <p><b>RamlaCMMsim</b> is a Web-based educational simulation created to educate
                learners about the theory and practice of the Coordinated Management of
                Meaning (CMM), a theory of communication. The simulation takes place in
                Ramla, Israel, a real community experiencing inter-communal conflict.
                Participants work as individuals or in groups, each person or group
                assuming the identity of one of three characters representing fictional
                members of Ramla's diverse Jewish and Arab communities. After analyzing a
                starting condition, players must address the situation from within their
                role by independently making a decision and providing a rationale for it.
                The combination of player decisions at each phase of the simulation
                determines a resulting condition for <b>RamlaCMMsim</b> - for better or worse.
                Participants work through two such decision phases and then confront and
                attempt to deconstruct a final condition. The simulation was created to
                work in an integrated way with workshop and class discussions facilitated
                by an instructor.</p>
